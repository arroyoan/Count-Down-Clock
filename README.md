## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://arroyoan.github.io/Count-Down-Clock/]

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was a great way for me to continue practicing my css skills, and I learned a lot about dealing with the date object in vanilla JavaScript.

### Continued development

If I were to continue developing this project I would add an animation to the counter cards, so that they looked like a vintage clock numbers changing.
